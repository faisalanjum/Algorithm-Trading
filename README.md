## Algorithm Trading

Algorithm Trading is a trading system implemented on QuantConnect's Algorithmic Framework. This system uses multiple alpha generation models to make trading decisions and implement them using the framework.

### Features

Some of the key features of Algorithm Trading include:

- Multiple alpha generation models
- Trading signals based on a combination of models
- Implementation using QuantConnect's Algorithmic Framework
- Backtesting and live trading capabilities

### Getting Started

To get started with Algorithm Trading, you will need to create an account on QuantConnect and set up a project. Once you have set up your project, you can clone this repository and upload the files to your project.

You will also need to set up your API keys in order to use QuantConnect's API. This will allow you to backtest and live trade using Algorithm Trading.

### Usage

To use Algorithm Trading, you will need to modify the settings in the `config.py` file to match your account settings and trading preferences. You can then run the `main.py` file to start the trading system.

Note that the trading models used in Algorithm Trading can be modified or replaced as desired. You can also add new models to the system if you have a model that you would like to test.
